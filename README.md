Example for the Meetup that will occurr on May 7th (https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/GFT-LATAM-Meetup/events/260381239/)

<h2>FizzBuzz details:</h2>
Given a number, system should print some text on screen, for each number from 1 to input value, accordingly to the logic below:
<li>Numbers divisible by 3, the 'Fizz' word should be printed;</li>
<li>Numbers divisible by 5, the 'Buzz' word should be printed;</li>
<li>Numbers divisible by 3 and 5, the 'FizzBuzz' word should be printed;</li>

If number prints Fizz and it divisible by 2, then prints Star instead (Apply this using TDD)
